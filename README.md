## What's up?

I love working on highly distributed systems, consensus-related algorithms, database internals.

### Zevm

I’m currently working on [zevm](https://github.com/farazdagi/zevm) - a highly optimized EVM Implementation in Zig.

###  Algorist
The [algorist](https://github.com/farazdagi/algorist) is a zero-unsafe Rust implementations of algorithms & data structures, for competetive programming.
The ultimate aim is to make Rust an easy choice for algorithms training.
